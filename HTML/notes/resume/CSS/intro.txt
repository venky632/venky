Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)

CSS is used for styling/Designing of the Web Page.
CSS can be implemented in HTML using three ways.
1. inline CSS: in the line of an element , we can write "style" as a property.
2. internal CSS: usually all css with selectors can be included in "Style" element
usually syntax
<style>
  selectors{
    propert:value;
  }
</style>
3. External CSS: you can write css in external file with extension .css and link that file in HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="link" />
Preferences:

class is used to identify the element or group of elements. multiple elements may have same class name or one element may have multiple class names.
to use class , we use . notation
